## Repository of stl's for probe adapters and probe docks. 

CAD files in the CAD directory. 

Docks and adapters are designed to be printed at either 0.2mm or 0.3mm layer heights. The probe dock stl's are offered with both Print In Place supports and withought. The best probe deployment results seem to be had by printing the probe duck upside-down: in the event that the PCB bears against the top of the dock when being deployed, this would be the best, top surface of your print. The bottom of the well surface can be a little rough and uneven.  

Note: there is a 5x5mm pocket to insert an optional magnet or ferrous object to retain the probe in the dock. It is not required. This was utilized in early stages of development and remains a legacy for now.
