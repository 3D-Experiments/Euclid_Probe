Repository of stl's for probe adapters and probe docks. 
CAD files in the CAD directory. 

Note: there is a 5x5mm pocket to insert an optional magnet or ferrous object to retain the probe in the dock. It is not required. This was utilized in early stages of development and remains a legacy for now.
