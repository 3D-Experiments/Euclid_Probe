# PROBE-BOARD

Magnetically coupled Z-Probe PCB sled, originally inspired and created for CroXY 3D Printer. Same PCB is used for upper and lower half. Uses 4, 1/4x1/8 or 8mmx3mm ring magnets, and an Omron D2F snap action switch, M3 mounting screws, and some other random bits and bobs you probably have laying about.  

SMT components are optional on the upper PCB to create visual indicator of switch action. 

Bottom board assembly: Solder the switch to the board and install the magnets. Magnets should be cinched down snug to the pads on the PCB. Pay attention to the magnet polarity as you assemble. You can clip the excess tails of the pins if desire. If you are using a right angle header mounted to the underside, you might need to for clearance.  

Top Board: Test out your magnets polarity direction- put a piece of paper over the board, and place the remaining magnets on top to orient themselves. Don't let the magnets slam together, they can chip. This way you can slide them off more easily. 

Solder on the standard 2.54mm pitch header of your choice- straight, or angled, DuPont, or JST-XH and solder it on. Optional SMT 1k resistor and LED can be installed in the position of your choice. Direct connection of the wires is also possible. Pin assignments / wiring connections are labeled for your convenience.   

SMT components: The pads are on both sides of the board, so you can reverse the position of the LEDS.  LEDS will ONLYy work oh the TOP board and if you connect a 3-pin header to SIG-VCC-GND. Mount a 1k 0603 resistor and 0803 LED of your choice. The pads are on both sides of the board, so you can reverse the position of the LEDS by flipping the board over. 

Example probe dock and .step files of assembled boards included for you convenience.

Magnets  - 1/4" od x 1/8" thick with countersunk hole for #2 screw, Axially Magnetized so that they stick face to face. Ideally you want magnets pairs so that they mate face to face. Here are some examples -

Screws for mounitng magnets- pilot holes are size for ~#2 sized or M2 self tapping plastic screws. Where to find 4 of them? Good question! Junked kids toys or electronics. If all else fails, throug drill it and use an M2 or #2 flat head screw and nut from the hardware store. A dab of Loqtite or super glue will keep it together nicely.
